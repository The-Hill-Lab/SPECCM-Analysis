# SPECCM-Analysis
Analysis Software for Photoelectrochemical SECCM Studies

This Python script is what we use in the analysis of electrochemical data obtained using Scanning ElectroChemical Cell Microscopy (SECCM) under intermittent illumination. This is the script referenced in Hill and Hill, Nano Letters, 2019 (https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b02336).

A piece of example data is provided for users to test the script on their machines. Please feel free to edit and employ for your own purposes as you wish. Questions can be directed towards the e-mail provided below.
